* I would be working on Deno and TypeScript of topics:

 1. Set Up the environment for deno
 
 2. Implementation
 
-> Using the TypeScript

-> RunTime and Linking to External Code along with Standard Libraries 

-> Finally Testing.

Hello! My name is Kunal Vohra and I plan to implement a simple project based on Deno and Typescript as a group project in Web Applications and Services [44-563-02]. What is Deno you ask? Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. It has a similar purpose as the conventional node.Js which you may be aware of but is a modernised implementation built in Rust.

Deno is more secured as compared to Javascript and it works on access permission issued through the command line interface. Node.js on the other hand normally has access to the whole user filesystem, making outgoing requests, accessing environment variables, etc.

Deno uses javascripts modern day library i.e. it can use the newer libraries which were created much later then Node.js was.

The primary differences in Deno and Node.js are stated in the table below
<table style ="width : 100%">
<tr>
<th>Node.js</th>    
<th>Deno<th>
<tr>
<tr>
<td><p>NodeJs is written in javascript and C++</p></td>
<td><p>Deno is written in typescript and Rust</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>NodeJs uses official package manager called NPM</p></td>
<td><p>Deno uses no package manager and ES modules can be imported from URLs</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>NodeJs program has access to anything a user can access</p></td>
<td><p>Deno has a sandbox security layer using permissions</p></td>
