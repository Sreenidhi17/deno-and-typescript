* I would be working on Deno and TypeScript of topics:

 1. Set Up the environment for deno
 
 2. Implementation
 
-> Create a deno-typeScript project

-> Linking to External Code along with Standard Libraries 

-> Create a controller for products

-> create TypeScript and function

The topics I would be covering in Deno and TypeScript 

* I would be going the implementation and processing using Deno. 

* I would be working on javascript, html and Css to develop a small project.

* I will put my hands on TypeScript as well.

* I would also be working on debugging.

Hello! My name is Kunal Vohra and I plan to implement a simple project based on Deno and Typescript as for this demo in Web Applications and Services [CS-44-563-02]. 

### What is TypeScript? 
JavaScript can be considered a subset of TypeScript. TypeScript can be described as a powerful type system which includes generics and JavaScript features. It has user friendly features like code Maintainability, enhanced productivity, code navigation and bug prevention. It also uses prototyping and class based Object-oriented style of coding which is not available in JavaScript. TypeScript code needs to be compiled unlike a JavaScript code.

### Difference between JavaScript and TypeScript
<table style ="width : 100%">
<tr>
<th>JavaScript</th>    
<th>TypeScript<th>
<tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions</p></td>
<td><p>Powerful type system, including generics & JS features</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>No Binding concept is available with JavaScript.</p></td>
<td><p>TypeScript uses concepts like types and interfaces to describe data being used.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Flexible and easy to learn, scripting language.</p></td>
<td><p>Stiff learning curve. Requires prior scripting knowledge.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>No need to compile JavaScript.</p></td>
<td><p>TypeScript code needs to be compiled</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

### What is Deno?
Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. It has a similar purpose as the conventional node.Js which you may be aware of, however it has a few advantages over it which might make it a first choice in the future.

Deno is more secured as compared to JavaScript and it works on access permissions issued through the command line interface. Node.js on the other hand normally has access to the whole user filesystem, making outgoing requests, accessing environment variables, etc.

Deno uses javascripts modern day library i.e. it can use the newer libraries which were created much later then Node.js was.

### Difference between Deno and Node.js 
<table style ="width : 100%">
<tr>
<th>Node.js</th>    
<th>Deno<th>
<tr>
<tr>
<td><p>NodeJs is written in javascript and C++</p></td>
<td><p>Deno is written in typescript and Rust</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>NodeJs uses official package manager called NPM</p></td>
<td><p>Deno uses no package manager and ES modules can be imported from URLs</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>NodeJs program has access to anything a user can access</p></td>
<td><p>Deno has a sandbox security layer using permissions</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

### Possible web applications using TypeScript and Deno

Deno can use an extensive set of open source modules modules hence it is safe to say there is a lot of projects that can be created. 

1. A page which lets you add the details of your pets and holds it for you on the server

2. A page which echos back

3. A simple text chat app

4. Taking data from user to generate a graph
