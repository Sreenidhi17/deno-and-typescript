 ### I would be working on Deno and TypeScript of topics:

 1. Set Up the environment for deno
 
 2. Implementation
 
* Create a deno-typeScript project

* Linking to External Code along with Standard Libraries 

* Create a controller for products

* create TypeScript and function

### Prerequisites
- Visual Stuido code
- justjavac.vscode-deno extension installed

### Process
- Clone the project from https://github.com/Sreenidhi17/deno-and-typescript
- In the cloned folder open the Visual Stuido code
- Open the terminal and run this command deno run --allow-net .\simpleServer.ts
- Once the command is run we see a message 'server running on port 3020'
- Then run http://localhost:3020/sree on your browser and you would see the json format output.

### Commands required to perform the skill
#### Before running the deno typescript we need to know basic commands.
- deno --help : provides all the available commands in deno
- deno run : run a program given a filename or url to the module
- deno install : install script as an executable
- deno cache : cache the dependencies
- --allow-net : Allows network access
- --allow-write : Allows file system write access
- --allow-read : Allows file system read access
- --allow-all : Allows all permissions

  ## The topics I covered in Deno and TypeScript: 
  
    * I worked on the implementation and processing using Deno.    
    * I worked on the typeScript and working of the code.

  ## You need to:
    * Download Visual Studio  
    * Download the Chocolatey
    * Download Deno
    * Install Extension- justJavac (Deno Support for VS code from Market Place) 
    * Download Postman Workplace (Optional)
    
  ## Commands to know? 
    * To run deno - run your deno followed by the file name; i.e., " deno run appPrash.ts ". 
   
   Will that work? Nah! you will need to allow permissions 
   
    * To give permission and allow access; "deno run --allow-net appPrash.ts".
   
   What else you can know? Version and details? 
    
    * Know all deno details on your computer; " deno --help ".
   
   How to allow write and read?
      
    * "allow -write" and "allow -read"

I would like to demostarte on **Deno and Typescript** using read and write example.

### Prerequisites:
* vs studio code
* Install the chocolatey
* justjavac.vscode-deno extension installed
* Download and Install Deno
### Process:
* Clone the project from https://github.com/Sreenidhi17/deno-and-typescript
*  In the cloned folder open the Visual Stuidocode 
* Open the terminal and run this command <br/>
`` deno run --allow-read reading_text.ts ``
* It will be reading from the sample text file.
* Open the terminal and run this command <br/> 
`` deno run --allow-write write.ts ``
* It will be writing from the NameIntroduction.txt file.
* The final write.ts output writes into the NameIntroduction.txt
### Commands to run the program:
* `` deno --help `` : provides all the available commands in deno
* `` deno run `` : run a program given a filename or url to the module
* `` deno install `` : install script as an executable
* `` allow-write `` : Allows file system write access
* `` allow-read `` : Allows file system read access

Hello! My name is Kunal Vohra and I plan to implement a simple project based on Deno and Typescript as for this demo in Web Applications and Services [CS-44-563-02]. 

### What is TypeScript? 
JavaScript can be considered a subset of TypeScript. TypeScript can be described as a powerful type system which includes generics and JavaScript features. It has user friendly features like code Maintainability, enhanced productivity, code navigation and bug prevention. It also uses prototyping and class based Object-oriented style of coding which is not available in JavaScript. TypeScript code needs to be compiled unlike a JavaScript code.

### Difference between JavaScript and TypeScript
<table style ="width : 100%">
<tr>
<th>JavaScript</th>    
<th>TypeScript<th>
<tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions</p></td>
<td><p>Powerful type system, including generics & JS features</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>No Binding concept is available with JavaScript.</p></td>
<td><p>TypeScript uses concepts like types and interfaces to describe data being used.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Flexible and easy to learn, scripting language.</p></td>
<td><p>Stiff learning curve. Requires prior scripting knowledge.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>No need to compile JavaScript.</p></td>
<td><p>TypeScript code needs to be compiled</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

### What is Deno?
Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. It has a similar purpose as the conventional node.Js which you may be aware of, however it has a few advantages over it which might make it a first choice in the future.

Deno is more secured as compared to JavaScript and it works on access permissions issued through the command line interface. Node.js on the other hand normally has access to the whole user filesystem, making outgoing requests, accessing environment variables, etc.

Deno uses javascripts modern day library i.e. it can use the newer libraries which were created much later then Node.js was.

### Difference between Deno and Node.js 
<table style ="width : 100%">
<tr>
<th>Node.js</th>    
<th>Deno<th>
<tr>
<tr>
<td><p>NodeJs is written in javascript and C++</p></td>
<td><p>Deno is written in typescript and Rust</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>NodeJs uses official package manager called NPM</p></td>
<td><p>Deno uses no package manager and ES modules can be imported from URLs</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>NodeJs program has access to anything a user can access</p></td>
<td><p>Deno has a sandbox security layer using permissions</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

### Possible web applications using TypeScript and Deno

Deno can use an extensive set of open source modules modules hence it is safe to say there is a lot of projects that can be created. 

1. A page which lets you add the details of your pets and holds it for you on the server

2. A page which echos back

3. A simple text chat app

4. Taking data from user to generate a graph
